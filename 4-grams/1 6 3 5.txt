a little boy plays 627
a lesson you would 627
a priest who works 627
a favour that which 627
i assume that firms 627
a second air space 627
a narrow age group 627

a fairly one sided 626
i prithee now sweet 626
i paused not wanting 626
a visage that looks 625
a record for getting 625
a person that looks 625
a client had given 625
i turned our faces 625
a street car passing 625
a peasant who owned 625
a realist who knows 625
i realize that where 625
a common but rather 625
a simple lap winding 625
a number that rises 625
a friend but could 625
a secret all right 625
a nigger and would 625
a lawyer all right 625
a shilling for which 625
a church can never 624
a speaker who talks 624
a cheese and fruit 624
a german man named 624

a cocked hat under 624

i pursue that point 624
a pretty big fight 624
a thought that every 624
a jersey cow which 624

a partial and moral 622
a colder and drier 622
a french and dutch 622

a sacred cow which 622
i myself was moved 622
a teacher and nurse 622
a pencil and slate 622

a comedy was acted 622
a corner she would 622
i assure you until 622
a version that works 621

a screen with round 621
a lumber and shingle 621
a greater and freer 621
a fairly low melting 621
a common and vital 621
i myself was given 621
a notice and motion 621
a vessel are liable 621
i bought this stock 621
i worked out where 621
a moment his usual 621
a demand for entry 621
a pretty mean trick 621
a layman who could 621
a finite mean value 621
