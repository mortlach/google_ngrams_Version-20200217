two incidents during interactive 69
two gentlemen were continually 69
this transition from agriculture 69
this subsection must demonstrate 69
this committee have undoubtedly 69
this afternoon will demonstrate 69
they recognize their differences 69
they themselves were transferred 69
then converted into temperature 69
that triggered their development 69
that stimulate their imaginations 69
that satisfies their preferences 69
that innovation must necessarily 69
that expresses your understanding 69
that consumers feel comfortable 69
that establish their eligibility 69
that americans have passionately 69
one generation were transmitted 69
now refreshed your recollection 69
not recognize their organization 69
not previously been permanently 69
not completed their quinquennial 69

new phenomena were encountered 69
new practices were implemented 69
new platforms were constructed 69

few instances will demonstrate 69
each component part contributes 69
can appreciate these differences 69
both townships have jurisdiction 69
both countries have jurisdiction 69
both companies were practically 69
are separated from individuals 69
are reasonably well articulated 69
are separated from construction 69
are processed into intermediate 69
are naturally more incredulous 69
are maintaining their competitive 69
are logically more fundamental 69
are necessary during development 69
are doubtless more significant 69
are certainly other differences 69
any departure from synchronism 69
and suggested some implications 69
and suppressing such publications 69

all expressed their condolences 69
all concerned will undoubtedly 69
using scholarly peer assessments 69
this procedure also facilitated 69
this discovery will necessarily 69

our happiness also corresponds 69
how pernicious such distinctions 69
his tragedies were represented 69
bac libraries were constructed 69

plea defendant must demonstrate 69
its reflection have contributed 69

two absorption peaks corresponding 68
two countries most responsible 68
this transition from adolescence 68
this statement pass unchallenged 68
they themselves were unsatisfied 68
they themselves were constrained 68
they interpret their relationship 68
then exhibited some photographs 68
