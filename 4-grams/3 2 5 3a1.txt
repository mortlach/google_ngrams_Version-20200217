not to beauty vow'd 378
and the broad leav'd 376
bid the snail pac'd 371
and by danger fir'd 271
sky as atlas fix'd 270
saw he dearly lov'd 263
act by which heav'n 244
and we often din'd 205
own we never fear'd 196
and no where fix'd 175

and be happy with't 130
not at glory aim'd 122

song thy fancy fir'd 94
for my reason fear'd 94
and the strong arm'd 94

any thing which cou'd 91
with the fiery rang'd 90
did the twice fir'd 89
but is still tam'd 86
and the reaper arm'd 84
and it grows isn't 82
and the green cat's 82

and the lilly bow'd 80
let me pause don't 79
ask the reason for't 79

song of heroes wak'd 76
that ear which joy'd 76
all the smooth fac'd 75
out at night they'd 73
shoe on stood fix'd 72
all the bench cou'd 72
and my sword rear'd 70

rear the spade arm'd 69
and by heaven don't 69
now no longer liv'd 68
lot of people don't 68
and be sorry for't 68
and the state fix'd 66
goes to wrack for't 65

any thing which wou'd 63
that the maxim wou'd 62

with thy heaven lov'd 60
not to exert one's 60
and he again rub'd 60
say we never fear'd 59
hear the white rob'd 54
had no reason for't 54
goes to wreck for't 52
men to whose lov'd 50
ish to blame for't 49
are on which heav'n 48
frae the sharp edg'd 47
and the treaty seal'd 47
man of straw cat's 46
long to quiet vow'd 46
that my guide ask'd 46
but if pluto does't 45
yet be hanged for't 43
with the short liv'd 43
all the bunch for't 43
out of place don't 42
head or gowns fring'd 42
she at evening rov'd 41
and the brown death's 41
who is first ask'd 40
