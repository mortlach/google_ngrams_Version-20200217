see no sense for't 910
all of false fac'd 889
that my father liv'd 840
not to beauty vow'd 826
had my brain sear'd 771
lay me stark nak'd 723
and by danger fir'd 424
and we often din'd 419
own we never fear'd 411
and the broad leav'd 376

see the pages dog's 288
sky as atlas fix'd 270
and no where fix'd 264
saw he dearly lov'd 263
but it really isn't 248
act by which heav'n 244
and the strong arm'd 229
with the fiery rang'd 216

now in danger try'd 210
now is nobly liv'd 208
song thy fancy fir'd 202
and be happy with't 196
for my reason fear'd 192
but is still tam'd 190
and the women cry'd 188
not at glory aim'd 184
him to speir for't 182
and the reaper arm'd 180
all the people cry'd 179
that ear which joy'd 172
and the green cat's 164

are so truly fear'd 158
and be sorry for't 155
sky the short liv'd 152

bid it round heav'n 125
that the maxim wou'd 124
ish to blame for't 121
not to exert one's 120
and he again rub'd 120
let me though fix'd 120

and the treaty seal'd 103
all my short liv'd 103
and the light fac'd 102
hath is sorry for't 101
long to quiet vow'd 100
that my guide ask'd 93
that the board wou'd 91
for us within heav'n 91
any thing which cou'd 91
did the twice fir'd 89
then my father dee'd 88
yet be hanged for't 87
all the bunch for't 86
she at evening rov'd 84
and if anything vex'd 83
and the brown death's 82
and it grows isn't 82
then be quite raz'd 81
who is first ask'd 81
out the burly bon'd 80
that the house wou'd 79
let me pause don't 79
thou as truly lov'd 77
song of heroes wak'd 76

with so deere lov'd 71
now the court heav'n 69
say it again don't 69
rear the spade arm'd 69
and by heaven don't 69

any thing which wou'd 63
then the flame rag'd 62
are so aptly mix'd 62
any or looks for't 61
how the hound bay'd 60
with thy heaven lov'd 60
hath an enemy cal'd 59
all the vision mix'd 59
thee be glory giv'n 59
say we never fear'd 59
with so deere lou'd 55
for the fowls wou'd 54
hear the white rob'd 54
but he never ask'd 51
that the world wou'd 50
men to whose lov'd 50
who it seems liv'd 49
this he first try'd 49
that the people wou'd 49
one we smart for't 49
all the angels heav'n 49
that he never lov'd 48
how the rogue wou'd 47
frae the sharp edg'd 47
but he never cou'd 46
man of straw cat's 46
they as strong ram'd 45
and by phoebe rear'd 45
age as twice sev'n 45
but if pluto does't 45
that my verse wou'd 44
and the goose ask'd 44
all the world wou'd 44
and of racks aim'd 43
with the short liv'd 43
who the devil cou'd 42
that he never wou'd 42
she on elbow lean'd 42
mug of cider lac'd 42
eye the seaman aim'd 42
out of place don't 42
head or gowns fring'd 42
how the girls wou'd 41
that the whole wou'd 40
men of taste wou'd 40
had to admit mom'd 40
