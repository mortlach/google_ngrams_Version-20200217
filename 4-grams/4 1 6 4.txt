away i looked over 376
cohn v kansas city 376
waving a languid hand 375
upon a little rock 375
time a report from 375
making a rueful face 375
made a silent wish 375

when a writer like 373
upon a formal hearing 373
upon a ground work 373
took a curious form 373
took a sudden bend 373
such a spirit must 373
room a coffee shop 373
onto a rotating drum 373
many a valley thief 373
many a school room 373
like a sunken ship 373
just a guessing game 373
into a corner saying 373
into a fallen tree 373
into a little lane 373
have a proper trial 373
have a cutoff date 373
