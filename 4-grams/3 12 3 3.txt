who accomplished all this 127
was manufactured and then 127
was intermittent for this 127
was discretionary and was 127
this subparagraph are any 127
this investigation has led 127
this discomfiture but then 127
this communication and this 127
then revolutionary idea that 127
that concurrently with its 127
ten commandments does not 127
tax expenditures they may 127
own manufactures and not 127

all accomplished man was 40
aid organizations and non 40
add impertinence and yet 40
thus notwithstanding his bad 40
this notwithstanding they did 40
this demonstrates that low 40
this demonstrates that long 40
this accomplished she had 40
that accomplished she was 40
its architecture was new 40
how melodramatic you are 40
how conscientious are you 40
god consciousness was not 40
for computational ease let 40
all denominations you say 40
all authorizations for and 40
with astonishment they saw 40
way communication and does 40
run elasticities for all 40
ray spectroscopy and with 40
you incapacitate each one 40
with exceptionally hot and 40
who experimented with all 40
who demonstrated that each 40
who anathematized all who 40
was hospitalized for ten 40
was individually his own 40
was consolidated with one 40
thus demonstrates that our 40
this confrontation can not 40
this conservatism has not 40
this justification may not 40
this indifference for his 40
this contamination did not 40
this surveillance was not 40
this displacement being due 40
then communication does not 40
that notwithstanding his ill 40
that demonstration can not 40
that peradventure she may 40
that consideration for his 40
that manufactures its own 40
that independence had not 40
she mechanically put her 40
she comprehended but one 40
our organizations are being 40
our acquaintance has not 40
nor corresponded with any 40
its disappearance was not 40
its availability has not 40
its architecture was not 40
his slovenliness and his 40
how discriminating was his 40
how contemptible you now 40
his subordinates may not 40
his collaborator and his 40
her determination that her 40
her acquaintance with his 40
has traditionally had few 40
for acquaintance with things 40
etc appropriations for meat 40
but relinquished his seat 40
but perseverance that had 40
but reorganization was not 40
but particularly with sir 40
but indifference was not 40
but inconsistent with her 40
but expostulated with them 40
but disconnected with one 40
but improvements are going 40
but complications are few 40
but concentrates all its 40
but contemplated them with 40
but architecture does not 40
but independence day was 40
being insufficient for his 40
are incompatible with both 40
are dissatisfied with one 40
are consequently not yet 40

and necessitated long and 40
and organizations are set 40
and modernization can not 40
and interference are not 40
and incidentally they can 40
and inefficiency are all 40
and interrogated them for 40
and incidentally one may 40
and intermarried with his 40
and interventions that aim 40
and incidentally for this 40
and incidentally this may 40
and illustrators who are 40
and helplessness are not 40
and environments that they 40
and epistemology are all 40
and expenditures did not 40
and disconnected with one 40
and displacement are not 40
and coordinators who are 40
and consolidated its own 40
and distributions are being 40
and confederated with them 40
and consequently may put 40
and counteracted this our 40
and demonstrated how that 40
and consequently this heat 40
and consequently are with 40
and disagreement with all 40
and consequently are using 40
and contemporary with his 40
and consequently this air 40
and conversations are all 40
and conveniences for its 40
and confrontation with his 40
and consequently both had 40
and contemporary men and 40
and amphibolites that are 40
and accidentally hit her 40
and adaptability are not 40
and accommodation has thus 40
and apprehensive that our 40
and accelerations for each 40
and presbyterians are all 40
and episcopalians are all 40
all interference with his 40
all requirements for this 40
and mournfulness that all 40
