i should say mental 55
i seemed now always 55
i shrank with terror 55
i opened them eagerly 55
i slowly got closer 55
i should new vigour 55
i served that church 55
i should thus revenge 55
i reckon our church 55
i passed that window 55
i pleaded for something 55
i should get proper 55
i knowed thet before 55
i marvel that whereas 55
i kissed this letter 55
i jerked and kicked 55
i hauled him inside 55
i kissed her parted 55
i killed and cleaned 55
i intend this volume 55
i loosed off myself 55
i huffed and pulled 55
i hauled out manure 55

i insist you finish 55
i missed him anyway 55
i helped her obtain 55

i before had spoken 55
i called him twenty 55
i deemed any further 55
i expect him almost 55
i follow her behind 55
i employ them better 55
i argued that nobody 55
i follow you clearly 55
i expect this volume 55
i became too feeble 55
i caught one drinking 55
i assume that initial 55
i desire that anyone 55
i coaxed and argued 55
