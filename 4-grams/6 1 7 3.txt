through a crowded car 78
through a glorious death 78
through a typical year 78
thought a subject for 78

select a husband and 78
seldom i confess yet 78
securing a divorce but 78

values a culture that 76
twirling a distaff let 76
training a subject now 76
through a blanket and 76

reject a nominee but 76
reform a revived and 76

reality a married man 76
rarely a pleasant one 76
pursue a phantom and 76

namely a proviso that 76
myself a miracle that 76
musket a bayonet and 76
moment i appeared both 76
moment m richard was 76
moment i believe him 76
molest a neutral and 76
mighty a monarch who 76
merely a heretic but 76
merely a recital and 76
merely a whisper but 76
member a bracket for 76
lights a carriage and 76
killed a comrade and 76
island a process that 76
invent a language and 76
intent a glorious day 76
indeed a thorough going 76
indeed a warfare and 76
granting a licence but 76
genius a haughty and 76
figure a process that 76
events a revision and 76
enough i suppose and 76
emptying a contact bed 76
elites a process that 76
effect a general one 76
effect a license for 76
eastern a western and 76
dinner a service and 76
derive a revenue but 76
deform a language this 76
deeply i believe that 76
creates a barrier and 76
created a duchess and 76
course a penalty for 76
course a balance has 76
course a refined and 76
course i realized she 76
commit a dacoity and 76
clinic i noticed that 76
cleaned a process that 76
choose i suggest that 76
chance i promise that 76
cattle a hundred and 76
career i suggest that 76
called a geodesic and 76
called a deposit and 76
called a puritan but 76
bought a license and 76
bodies i suggest that 76
becoming a soldier does 76
become a boarder and 76
become a builder and 76
become a college man 76
become a tragedy and 76
become a chattel and 76
became a college with 76

without a village and 75
without a mediator but 75
without a program you 75
without a contest was 75
without a position but 75
violating a statute but 75
varied i believe that 75

through a barrier but 75
through a regular war 75
therein a fireman and 75
thereby a conduit for 75
termed a natural death 75
teacher a student may 75
system a totally new 75

stakes a hundred and 75
spending a vacation and 75
speaker a question and 75
sorrow a creature that 75
something i warrant you 75
someone a certain way 75
singular a position and 75
simply a carrier and 75
silica a mineral that 75
shadow i realized that 75
severe a regimen but 75
seized a stopper and 75
seized a bayonet and 75
securing a foothold and 75
secure a beachhead and 75

online a process that 75
office i promise you 75
office i withdrew for 75
office i suppose that 75
number a thousand but 75
number a process that 75
needed a library and 75
nature a creature but 75
nature a stronger man 75
nature a certain way 75
myself i despise him 75
myself i welcome any 75
movies i realized that 75
mosque a library and 75

merely a country but 75
merely a mollusk and 75
merely a defense but 75
merely a parable but 75
merely a national god 75
memory i present you 75
memoir i believe that 75
member a ratchet and 75
master a certain sum 75
market i warrant him 75
mainly w african but 75
lovers a husband and 75
letter i advised you 75
latter a decision that 75
joined a convent but 75
itself a relation but 75
itself a paradox and 75

caused a runaway and 75
caused a drought and 75
caused a dispute and 75
called a veteran who 75
called a mystery that 75
called a variety but 75

purely a charity and 60
punish a wrongdoer but 60
public a problem that 60
potent a caustic and 60

invent a language but 60
inside a doorway and 60
insane a patient may 60
indeed a fanatic and 60

entering a foreign war 59
ensure a precise fit 59
enfeoff a stranger and 59

raised a counter cry 47
purely a symptom and 47

farmer a century ago 45
family a century and 45
expect a present and 45
exists a solution can 45
excuse a witness does 45
estate a notable one 45
essays i suggest that 45
errors a minimum and 45
enough i believe but 45
enough a question that 45
engaged a company and 45
energy y radiation and 45
enacting a federal law 45
employ a married man 45

simply a company but 41
simply a renewal and 41

indeed a peaceful one 41
