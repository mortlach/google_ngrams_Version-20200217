short liv'd beauties die 356
light arm'd archers far 238
heaven heav'n witness thou 220
white arm'd goddess thus 166
sight wou'd entitle him 130
short liv'd offerings but 117
which sho'd fastest run 91
shall see't rebated with 79
image rear'd trembling and 76
rider sav'd against his 75
burst for't because that 61
still lean'd towards this 59
terms don't provoke him 52
white rob'd levites and 51
please wou'd quietly sue 51
paper leav'd between that 50
motion cou'd restore and 48
often urg'd against you 44
odors arm'd against them 43
verse wou'd blemish all 43
maids sho'd censure thee 41
