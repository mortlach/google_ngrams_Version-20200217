this notwithstanding that we are 40
this investigation lead to two 40
this determination that it was 40
this demonstration that it was 40
this circumstance led to its 40
they accomplished was to get 40
then reconsidered and it was 40
that subjectively they do not 40
that privatization per se does 40
that notwithstanding all the new 40
that mademoiselle and the lad 40
that incumbrances are of two 40
that incorporated all of them 40
that communication can be both 40
that consciousness may at this 40
that contradicted one of his 40
that independence day is not 40
