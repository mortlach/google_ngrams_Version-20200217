appeared a large deep opening 41
although i still have hopes 41
against a power three times 41
stephen m helping other people 41
congress a basis upon which 41
written a motto from scott 40
suspect i would have given 40
suppose a party were shown 40
returns a season clear shining 40
rescues a child from water 40
receive a visit from queen 40
provide a solid base which 40
printed a dozen years after 40
printed a small part thereof 40
prevent a rival from getting 40
prevent a woman from gaining 40
prevent a court from drawing 40
perhaps a dozen more which 40
occupying a space only about 40
lecture i shall talk about 40
friends i still have today 40
following a faint game trail 40
flashed a movie star smile 40
everything i would have given 40
enjoyed a brief boom period 40
enclose a large arid plain 40
doubted i would ever again 40
covered a large city block 40
command a price well above 40
carried a large book under 40
believe i could ever write 40
believe i would have fired 40
although i could have added 40
against a strong land power 40
adopted a dozen years later 40
achieve a lasting peace after 40
society a short time after 40
perhaps i might have shown 40
perhaps i might have ended 40
british a brisk young lover 40
