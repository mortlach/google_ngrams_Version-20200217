a question that had bothered 646
a species and its habitat 645
a minimum age and service 645
i believe has not hitherto 644
a verdict for one hundred 640
a penalty for his default 638

a southern man with northern 601
a scholar who had studied 600
i foresee that this picture 600
i believe that our program 600
a project for that purpose 598
a pitcher and two glasses 598
a language that can express 598
i believe that this example 597
a lightning rod for critics 596
a warrant for any violation 595
a program that can provide 594
a concept that has emerged 594
i commend you and senator 592
i believe that this concern 591
a natural and easy process 590

a material for this purpose 587
i replied that his majesty 586
a problem that had existed 585
i require thee and beseech 583
a verdict for two thousand 582
a soldier for his country 580
i suspect that this species 580
a solution for this equation 579

a problem with this solution 574
i watched him for several 574
i suggest that you appoint 571
i believe that this research 571
a taxable year that results 570

a problem that had puzzled 549
i watched them for several 549
i believe that few persons 548
a problem that has worried 547
a machine gun was mounted 547
i suggest that you provide 547
a penalty for this violation 546
a hundred and two degrees 545
i assumed she was referring 545
a petition does not contain 543
a warrant for one thousand 540
a student who had studied 539
a retiree who was married 539
i believe that our decision 539

i believe that this solution 512
a pattern that was similar 511
a solution for each problem 509
a problem that has haunted 508
a question that had haunted 507
a central and east european 507
a witness for any purpose 506

a captain and one hundred 481
a thousand and one moments 479
a process for this purpose 478
a present for his majesty 477

i suggest with all respect 476
a country that has enjoyed 475
i suspect this was because 475
l masters and jean houston 474
i believe that this happens 474
i believe that with careful 473
a maximum and then remains 472
a hundred and odd thousand 472
a verdict was then entered 471
a process that can involve 471

i believe one may venture 439
a petition for its judicial 438
a council for this purpose 438
a charter for this company 438
a similar one for himself 436
a heinous sin and scandal 436
a superior being our reasonings 435

i believe that our farmers 422
i believe you are expecting 422
a pattern that has emerged 421
i somehow can not imagine 421
a country that has hitherto 420
a stranger who had arrived 419
a sandbar and ran aground 419
a certain way with certain 419
a variable and its negation 418
a trustee can not enforce 418

i believe that our failure 417
a question that has baffled 416
a shallow bow and replies 415
a quarrel with this country 415

a witness for not attending 403
a receipt for that popular 403
i suppose you are shocked 403
a wounded man was brought 402
a question and then answers 402
a creature that was current 402
a hundred and six thousand 401
a subpoena for that purpose 400
a position with that company 400

a thousand and one sources 276
a process that can include 276
a maximum and then dropped 276
i grabbed her and started 276
a victory for his country 275
a deposit for any taxable 275
a bandage was then applied 275
i propose that this question 275
i believe that for several 275
a witness who may present 274
a statute can not control 274
a revenue for that purpose 274
a penalty for this offence 274
a culture that has evolved 274
a concept that has existed 274

i trusted him with everything 268
i believe that this election 268
a witness for that company 267

a variable that can contain 252
a regular way with increasing 252
a country does not provide 252
a company that has managed 252
a certain air that familiar 252
a bequest for this purpose 252

i believe this was largely 246
i believe that any student 246
i believe that this purpose 246
a subject that has puzzled 245
a slender rod with rounded 245
a receipt for its payment 245
a program does not provide 245
a delusion that his haughty 245
a company can not succeed 245

a pretext was too hastily 239
a plastic bag and carried 239
a maximum and then steadily 239
a dilemma that has plagued 239
i suppose they are reserving 239
i imagine how this follows 239
i believe that our language 239
a veteran may not receive 238
i request that this article 238
i indulge you ten minutes 238
a verdict was had against 237
a trustee for any purpose 237
a present for his trouble 237
a natural law that governs 237
a carrier can not justify 237
i believe that this exchange 237
a workman who was repairing 236
a uniform air gap between 236
a similar one was erected 236
a senator who was present 236
i believe that our request 236
a solution that can satisfy 235

i believe that his decision 234
a subject that has claimed 233
a lightning rod for debates 233
a license was not granted 233
a journal and not sustain 233
a control for red spiders 233
a company and its affairs 233
a company and was elected 233
i queried not with destiny 233
a freedom with his betters 232
a chamber long and spacious 232
i suggest that this pattern 232
i believe that any senator 232
a verdict for his clients 231
a question that has several 231
a problem with that concept 231
a present for her majesty 231
a plastic bag and wrapped 231
a patient who may require 231
a natural and easy solution 231
a husband can not dispose 231

a subject for this chapter 230
a service and can provide 230
a pilgrim who had visited 230
a mystery that had baffled 230
a company does not operate 230
a vacancy and was elected 229

a pleasant seat for himself 229
a pattern that was typical 229
a fervent zeal for liberty 229
a country that had enjoyed 229
a carrier with all persons 229

a shorter man than himself 228
a problem with this program 228
a product can not recover 228
a position you are reduced 228

a species that can survive 227
a solution for our present 227
a question any way material 227
a patient who had escaped 227

i suggest that this article 227
i believe that for certain 227
a solution for her problem 226
a product that you believe 226
a program that has existed 226
a position for her husband 226
a picture she had painted 226

a subject for this article 225
a geologic map and sections 225
a context and that context 225
a college for this purpose 225
i totally was not expecting 225
i released him and stepped 225
i believe that its general 225
a soldier who had escaped 224
a process and that process 224
i believe god has brought 224
i believe they are referring 224

a question that has hitherto 221
a husband who has married 221
a country that can provide 221
i noticed that she carried 221
i believe that all aspects 221
i believe that this history 221
a similar act was enacted 220

i believe that sir charles 219
i believe that his efforts 219
a request for aid against 218
a mandate for that purpose 218
a husband for her together 218
a country can not increase 218
a context for this chapter 218
a channel for his thoughts 218
i suspect you are familiar 218
i believe that that country 218
a student who was preparing 217
a stranger who had appealed 217
a receipt for that payment 217
a penalty for this offense 217
a hurried and low whisper 217
a husband who can provide 217
